Overview1   

Each player in Coloretto is collecting sets of cards in the same colour. The players draw cards from a card supply in the middle of the table. 

During the game, the players try to specialise in a few colours, because at the end of the game, a player can score plus points for only 3 colours; the rest score minus points. 

The more cards a player has of a colour, the more points they score.    

On a players turn, they take one of the two following actions  A. draw and place a card in a row,  or  B. take a card row.    
Then the other player takes a turn. When both players have taken a card row, the round ends and a new round begins.  

The game ends after the end of the round when the “last round” card appears. At the end of the last round, the players decide which colour their jokers are (each may be different) and then scores their cards. 

The players choose which 3 of their colours score plus points, and the rest of the colours score minus points. 

The player with the highest total wins.
